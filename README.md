SplitPanelContainer
===================

This is a Xamarin.iOS View Container to enable the presentation of a 3 column split view controller consisting of a menu, flyout sub menu, and detail view.
Included is a MvvmCross iPad Presenter to present views (within a navigation controller) as either a single view, custom split view or a modal view.

Inspiration and some flyout code pinched from patbonecrusher's SlidingPanels.Touch.

This project is still a work in progress and is not complete nor fully functional.
